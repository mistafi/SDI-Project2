<p>I decided to expound on my trip story, and give a little more information. I added the distance, calculating stops, and the basic cost for gas on the trip. I also added a list of places we stopped along the way.</p>
<p>I tried to be more complex with some of the calculations, just like I observed in the lessons. Some of them worked really well, and others left me baffled as they would not work at all. The experience was very frustrating, and it took way longer than 8 hours for me to churn this out.</p>
<p>This project was the hardest thus far. I really had a hard time getting my returns to connect in other places in my data. I could output a return, but reusing it was a problem.</p>
